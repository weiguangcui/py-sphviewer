Py-SPHViewer
=================

Py-SPHViewer is a framework for rendering particles in Python using the Smoothed 
Particles Hydrodynamics. It was born from my interest in 
making movies of cosmological nbody+hydrodynamical simulations. Although it is under 
development, I consider that in its current version it can be distributed 
without major warnings and of course without any warranty. The project is 
hosted at https://github.com/alejandrobll/py-sphviewer/, where you will 
find relevant information, tutorials, news, etc.

If you use Py-SPHViewer in any publication, I'll be very happy if you thanks
the project at the end. For any request, comments, please contact me.
